# pICe - PNG integrity checker
A PNG file integrity checker that verifies compliance with the [PNG Standard v1.2](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Contents.html).

> [!WARNING]
> pICe is currently work in progress.
> Not all features have been implemented yet and existing features have not been tested thoroughly!

## üëì Overview

pICe is a lightweight command-line tool designed to validate the output of PNG encoders and inspect the structure of PNG files. It is ideal for:
- Developers working on PNG encoders.
- Debugging and inspecting malformed PNG files.
- Ensuring PNG files comply with the official PNG specification.

## üî® Building pICe
Currently, only Linux is supported. To build the project, follow these steps:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ElPatriccio/pICe.git
  cd pICe
  make
```
After compilation, the binary will be located in the build directory. You can run it with:
```bash
  ./build/pice <your_image.png>
```

## üîé Example
```text
  ./build/pice assets/test.png

## üí° Features
As of now, pICe is able to verify the basic file structure. pICe checks if every standard chunk is at the right place, in the correct order and appears only as often as the standard allows.
